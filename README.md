# Bash Missions

This repo has a bunch of Bash scripts I built while learning DevOps.

## Scripts Included

1. `compare_numbers.sh` — Compares two numbers and prints which one is greater, lesser, or if they’re equal.
2. `file_checker.sh` — Takes a filename input and checks if it exists.
3. `string_compare.sh` — Takes two strings and compares them for equality.
4. `directory_check.sh` — Asks the user for a directory name and checks if it exists.
5. `function_calculator.sh` — A simple Bash calculator using functions for arithmetic operations.
6. `for_loop.sh` — Demonstrates a basic `for` loop in Bash.
7. `while_loop.sh` — Uses a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt user input.
8. `case_menu.sh` — A menu-based script using `case` statements for multi-option selection.
9. `file_ops.sh` — Accepts a filename and allows adding text to it using standard input.

These scripts were all written and tested on an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2023, then transferred to my Mac and pushed to GitHub for version control. Missions completed so far: 1 through 6.
